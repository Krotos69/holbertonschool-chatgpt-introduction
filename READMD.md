A project structure overview gives readers a clear map of how everything in your repository is organized. It helps newcomers understand where to find code, documentation, examples, and exercises without digging around blindly. For a project focused on **debugging** and **automation with ChatGPT**, a clean structure makes the learning flow intuitive.

## 🗂️ Project Structure Overview

A structure like this works well for your project:

### 📁 Root Directory
- **README.md**  
  The main entry point explaining the project, objectives, outcomes, and how to get started.

- **src/**  
  Contains all source code used in debugging and automation exercises.

- **debugging/**  
  A dedicated folder with buggy code samples across multiple languages for hands‑on debugging practice.

- **automation/**  
  Includes tasks where ChatGPT generates boilerplate code, documentation, or unit tests.

- **examples/**  
  Demonstrations of how ChatGPT can assist in debugging and automation, serving as reference material.

- **docs/**  
  Additional documentation, guides, and explanations that support the learning process.

- **tests/**  
  Basic unit tests—some intentionally incomplete—to practice AI‑assisted test generation.

- **assets/**  
  Images, diagrams, or supplementary materials used in documentation or examples.

- **config/**  
  Optional configuration files for tools, linters, or environment setup.

This layout keeps the project modular, easy to navigate, and aligned with real‑world development practices.

If you'd like, I can expand this into a full directory tree with descriptions or tailor it to a specific language ecosystem like Python, JavaScript, or Java.
