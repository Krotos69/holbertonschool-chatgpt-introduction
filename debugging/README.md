ChatGPT – Introduction
Enhancing Code Quality and Efficiency with ChatGPT
Project Overview
This project explores how AI can elevate software development by focusing on two essential areas: debugging and automation. Through hands on activities, you’ll learn to use ChatGPT as a powerful development companion—one that helps identify and resolve errors more efficiently while automating repetitive tasks that typically slow down your workflow.
By integrating AI into your coding process, you’ll not only boost productivity but also improve the overall structure, clarity, and reliability of your code. This project mirrors real world development scenarios, preparing you for a future where AI assisted programming is the norm.
Objectives
•   Debugging 
Understand how AI can assist in identifying and resolving coding errors. You’ll work with ChatGPT to diagnose and correct bugs across multiple programming languages, strengthening your problem solving skills and deepening your understanding of common programming pitfalls.
•   Automation 
Learn to automate repetitive or time consuming coding tasks using ChatGPT. This includes generating boilerplate code, documentation, and basic unit tests—allowing you to focus on more complex and creative aspects of development.
Expected Outcomes
•   Enhanced Debugging Skills 
Build confidence in troubleshooting and refining code. You’ll learn to clearly articulate problems and apply AI driven solutions effectively.
•   Automation Proficiency 
Develop the ability to leverage AI for automating coding tasks, resulting in cleaner, more structured, and more reliable code.
Why This Matters
By pushing the boundaries of traditional coding methods, this project equips you with skills that are increasingly valuable in the modern tech landscape. You’ll learn to code smarter, faster, and more efficiently—embracing AI as a collaborative tool rather than just a novelty.
